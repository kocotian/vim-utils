vim-utils
=========

Simple package for utilities that was sitting in my vimrc long, now as plugin.
Contains:
* Line moving shortcuts
* Faster opening new line without going to Insert Mode
* Simple macros starting with semicolon for faster code editing
* A few simple functions (for now only one :/)
